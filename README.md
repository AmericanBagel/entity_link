# Entity Link
A library data pack built with JMC which links entities to other entities, based on @CloudWolfYT's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=685vs5hNQmk)

## About
Entity Link is a library data pack built with [JMC](https://github.com/WingedSeal/jmc/) which links entities to other entities based on @CloudWolfYT's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=685vs5hNQmk). While @CloudWolfYT's video is great and served largely as a basis for Entity Link, Entity is assembled for you -- no need to figure out how to assemble it. Additionally, Entity Link allows you to link any entity to any other entity; @CloudWolfYT's tutorial, while obviously just a tutorial to get started, only permits linking a player to an entity (the most common use-case).

# Uses
Entity linking is incredibly useful. Use-case examples include:
- Multiplayer-friendly interactions between a player and player-specific entities which last over 1 tick:
    - Linking a player and a villager for right-click detection to prevent any bugs in multiplayer. The `distance` selector is not a good idea! Just link them~
    - Linking a player and an entity for left-click detection.
    - Linking a player and a chest minecart for multiplayer-compatible GUIs.
    - Pets! Perhaps you want to make a pet-related data pack. UUIDs are annoying and require multiple scoreboards and NBT tag reading. Entity linking is more efficient and easier.
    - Per-player armor stand/custom model cosmetics
    - Get creative!
- Multiplayer-friendly interactions between two entities

## Using
### With [JMC](https://github.com/WingedSeal/jmc/)
#### Linking entities
- Tag entity 2 with entity_link.init
- Execute `entity_link.link()` as entity 1

Quite simple, right?

*For an example, see the `entity_link.examples.summon` function in `src/examples.jmc`.*

#### Searching for linked entity
- Execute `entity_link.search()` as entity 1
- Linked entities will now have the `entity_link.linked` tag. Select linked entities using `@e[tag=entity_link.linked]`.
- Run `entity_link.clean()`. As of writing, the `clean` function just removes the `entity_link.linked` tag. You could remove it manually (`tag @e remove entity_link.linked`), but the `clean` function may change in the future, so use it to be quick and future safe.

*For an example, see the `entity_link.examples.tp` function in `src/examples.jmc`.*

### With vanilla mcfunction
- Tag entity 2 with entity_link.init
- Execute `function entity_link:entity_link/link` as entity 1

Quite simple, right?

*For an example, see the `entity_link.examples.summon` function in `src/examples.jmc`. JMC syntax is quite easy to convert to mcfuntion syntax. If you can't understand JMC syntax at all, you may refer to `data/entity_link/functions/entity_link/examples/summon. Be warned: the mcfunction files are computer-generated and undocumented!*

#### Searching for linked entity
- Execute `function entity_link:entity_link/search` as entity 1
- Linked entities will now have the `entity_link.linked` tag. Select linked entities using `@e[tag=entity_link.linked]`.
- Run `function entity_link:entity_link/clean`. As of writing, the `clean` function just removes the `entity_link.linked` tag. You could remove it manually (`tag @e remove entity_link.linked`), but the `clean` function may change in the future, so use it to be quick and future safe.

*For an example, see the `entity_link.examples.tp` function in `src/examples.jmc`. JMC syntax is quite easy to convert to mcfuntion syntax. If you can't understand JMC syntax at all, you may refer to `data/entity_link/functions/entity_link/examples/tp. Be warned: the mcfunction files are computer-generated and undocumented!*

## Installing
### Using [DatapackBuildManager](https://github.com/ICY105/DatapackBuildManager)
1. Install [DatapackBuildManager](https://github.com/ICY105/DatapackBuildManager) using its instructions and construct a `dependencies.json` file.
2. Add the following object to the `dependencies` object in `dependencies.json`:
    ```{
        "name": "Entity Link",
        "url": "https://github.com/AmericanBagel/entity_link"
      }```
3. Run `build-datapack.py` based on the instructions in [DatapackBuildManager](https://github.com/ICY105/DatapackBuildManager)'s docs, and Entity Link should be installed!

### Manually
If none of your data pack's dependencies require [Lantern Load](https://github.com/LanternMC/load):
1. Drag, drop, and merge the `data` folder into your data pack's directory
2. Go into `data/load/tags/functions/load.json` and append your data pack's load tag/function.
3. Use Entity Link based on the docs

If you are already using [Lantern Load](https://github.com/LanternMC/load)  or a dependency requires it:
1. Install [Lantern Load](https://github.com/LanternMC/load) using the instructions in the docs if you haven't already.
2. Drag and drop the `data/entity_link` directory into your pack's `data` directory.
3. Go into `data/load/tags/functions/load.json` and add `"entity_link:__load__",` before your pack's load tag/function or, if you prefer, add it to `data/load/tags/functions/pre-load.json` instead.
4. Use Entity Link based on the docs above.

# Redistributing or modifying Entity Link
Feel free to redistribute and modify Entity Link in any way you want to. I don't care! I won't force you to, but please add credit if you care to. Simply adding, "This datapack uses [EntityLink](https://github.com/AmericanBagel/entity_link) by [AmericanBagel](https://github.com/AmericanBagel/)." to your README is enough! What? Your project isn't on an open-source git repository? Make it on an open-source git repository! Don't want to? Fine. Just add some form of credit if you feel like it! Again, I won't force you to! Do what you want! I don't care!

If you want to modify Entity Link for your pack:
1. Search and replace "entity_link" in "entity_link.jmc" with a prefix followed by `entity_link` e.g. `my_project.entity_link`.
2. In `src/jmc_config.json`, replace `entity_link` with that same prefixed variation, e.g. `my_project.entity_link`.
3. Compile it with JMC!

If you don't have JMC, use some directory-wide search-and-replace function -- VSCode/VSCodium has one -- and replace `entity_link` with your prefixed variation, i.e. `my_project.entity_link`.
